## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Lidar Data Summary

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Hide this chunk to avoid printing it in output
library(lidR)
library(glue)
ctg <- catalog(glue::glue('{proj_dir}/input/class'))

```

```{r}
plot(ctg, mapview = T)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
